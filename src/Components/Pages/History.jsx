                            <p className=" text-muted mt-5 data">In a universe which exists in an alternate reality, there lived a clan of bulls who bowed to no one but their master – Gilgamesh. The bulls knew their realm would cease to flourish if Gilgamesh was harmed. What gave him this power to rule was a tale of ancient times, many believed it never happened, yet many had seen the signs of the epic battle that Gilgamesh had won against the ferocious lords of creation. To this day, some could hear the distant screams of the bears who were turned to pixels by the lords, so they would rely on concoctions to help their fading minds and drift them off to a restful sleep.</p>

                        <div className="col-md-9 col-xl-8 col-lg-10 col-xxl-7 ">

                            <p className=" text-muted mt-5 data">Had it not been for Gilgamesh, Heracles would not rule over his kind, for his kind would have been wiped off the face of the realm. While the bears were a powerful force against the lords, they did not possess the intellect of the bulls – especially that of their forerunner. For this reason, Heracles knew there was a debt unpaid and lived in unison with the kingdom of Gilgamesh, trading coins of all kinds to ensure commerce was sustained and even allowed his subjects to take the hand of a bull in marriage. Deep inside however, Heracles was wounded; haunted by the images of that fateful day. He was raised to be a master, but no one could have predicted the arrival of the lords. It was the unique instinct which Gilgamesh possessed in warfare which became a cause for his envy, and while Heracles remained cordial over the years, he waited for the day he would be able to stand with his head held up high against his arch-enemy, victorious; admired; celebrated.</p>

                        <div className="col-md-9 col-xl-8 col-lg-10 col-xxl-7 ">

                            <p className=" text-muted mt-5 data">Many among the realm of the bulls had acquired a fortune through trading, and now, this fortune was used to make Gilgamesh more powerful. They believed he would never have been victorious had he not himself been a Lord – the righteous lord who protected an entire kingdom against the lords of creation and banished them with nothing but his instinct. Gilgamesh now spent his days in meditation, harnessing the power he held within to protect both kingdoms against any threats they may ever see again. His time, he said, was precious. The scales were always tipping. And so the wealthy bulls maintained a continuous program of exchange between the bulls and bears, trading insights and secrets, creating a market of information which fed both peas in the pod.</p>

                        <div className="col-md-9  col-xl-8 col-lg-10 col-xxl-7 ">

                            <p className=" text-muted mt-5 data">Everyone in the kingdom never knew about another bone of contention between Gilgamesh and Heracles – Freya. She was the most beautiful bear the kingdom had ever seen and Heracles’s younger sister, the long lost love of Gilgamesh. Before they left this realm, the lords of creation casted Freya into a web of ether, turning her into a lifeless yet immortal being who could no longer feel, but only think. She was alive, in a way unknown to everyone else. Gilgamesh would still speak with her past sometimes, but not her present, and it was believed by many that one day, Gilgamesh would step through the simulation of this realm to meet his beloved Freya, leaving everything behind. Heracles knew Freya was more than just someone’s love – she was meant to be the queen.</p>

                        <div className="col-md-9 col-xl-8 col-lg-10 col-xxl-7 ">

                            <p className=" text-muted mt-5 data">Most of the secrets of Gilgamesh and Heracles were kept under guard by the wealthiest of the bulls and bears, for they knew the many happy families, the millions of people living in harmony within the realm would once again lose their sense of belonging, if they knew. So they were allowed to lead their lives in oblivion, celebrating the normalcy of their lives and creating a new generation through interbreeding – the Burls, fated to be the inheritors of a legacy the lords of creation left behind.</p>

                        <div className="col-md-9 col-xl-8 col-lg-10 col-xxl-7 ">

                            <p className=" text-muted mt-5 data">The Burls were a unique creature, fungible during the day and non-fungible as they slept. They could read minds and look into the past, but never did they reveal the ugly secrets of the past. They spoke no evil and did no harm. Both Gilgamesh and Heracles knew if the Burls were to lead, the future would be kind, but their species was still in a phase of growth, no Burl had grown old enough to marry another Burl and so, the kingdom had to wait.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div className="col-md-9 col-xl-8 col-lg-10 col-xxl-7 ">

                            <p className=" text-muted mt-5 data ">One of the Burls had grown an affinity for Gilgamesh and wanted to be in his service. He wanted to learn the art of meditation and gain the instincts which led Gilgamesh in the battle against the lords. His thirst for this knowledge led him to the forum where Gilgamesh lived every day, asking for a consultation. Every day he was turned away, yet something kept him coming back. He spoke of a dream he frequently had, a dream only Gilgamesh could explain – a dream which held a remedy for Freya.</p>

                        <div className="col-md-9 col-xl-8 col-lg-10 col-xxl-7 ">

                            <p className=" text-muted mt-5 data ">This Burl had a rare name, Nifta. No one knew exactly what it meant, but him. When asked about its meaning, Nifta would say only Gilgamesh is destined to know. The day Nifta would be granted an audience with Gilgamesh was yet to come.</p>
