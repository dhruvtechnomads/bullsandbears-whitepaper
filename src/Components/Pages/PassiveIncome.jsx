We try to bring a unique new way of utility in every aspect of what NFTs might mean to you.  Does that mean we are coming out with complicated constructions?  Far from it.  Does that mean we are special, certainly not, but what I do know is… every step that we take, is to make sure it makes us as a community better.</p>

                                <p className=" text-muted mt-5 data">Many projects launch their own token in which you will need to invest or which is used to pay-out an actual return on your investment (holding the NFT).  That token can then be used to buy that project’s own products.  Unfortunately how green the grass may seem, the majority of these tokens have close to zero ‘real world’ value and won’t benefit anyone, mostly due to liquidity issues which bring major price fluctuations with it.  Other projects smash you with their airdrops left and right of extra NFTs as some kind of passive income, but in the end… you’re left with a bunch of NFTs which assumably never will create any real value but for the owner himself, because the backbone of these projects is so weak, they’ll never get adopted outside of the NFT space.  Those NFTs will end up just being good enough to print and to hang up somewhere in a room.  Other projects launch their own game (first person shooter, open world, … and no. 907 in the row) where you can use your NFTs or tokens to again, only be used with their product.  And yes… for a handful of these game projects, you will be able to earn extra tokens while actively playing the games and in a later stage, convert these tokens to other more reliable tokens, which then can be converted to $$.  But how many of these games you think will still exist 5 years from now?  And how many of these games that will exist, will actually have been adopted on a greater scale? And if so… are you planning to play these games all day long or engage with them on a daily basis to earn these tokens or gifts… because however you fold it… does that make it so much different than a 9-5 job?</p>

This project was mainly launched finding a way to help anyone who really believes in our idea and invests for the long term. The idea behind Bulls and Bears is so strong that, even if we are the biggest failure that the NFT market has ever seen, we will still be able to proceed with our promised passive income plan for our holders.<br/>And that’s a fact!</p>

Even if the project doesn’t kick off big time, we will still be making our juicy $$ along the way. But.. if we actually do get a lot more traction, we can create f.e. more NFTs for these new investors (which will grow the investment amount and benefit all existing members), grow the existing community, launch our planned P2E mobile and desktop game, enter the metaverse, etc.  We will easily be able to raise the bar on our current basic passive income plan and on top of that… we will have the extra funds to invest in other projects which will create and bring more value to all of us passively!  But first things first…. Let’s check below what we have to offer for you as our absolute minimum.</p>
